### Dashboard

The dashboard allows you to toggle settings and run automation tasks. Activate the dashboard using  `Command` + `Shift` + `\`.

### Fullscreen Mode

Enabling **Fullscreen Mode** using the dashboard will automatically trigger fullscreen when an application is launched. Additionally, all active application windows will be fullscreened.

Once disabled, fullscreen applications will be returned to windowed mode.

#### Multiple Displays

When a second display is attached, Fullscreen Mode is automatically disabled. When a second display is disconnected, Fullscreen Mode is enabled.

### Window Manipulation

Windows and fullscreen applications can be moved between screens using hotkeys `Command` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Left` and `Right`. 

A window can be maximized to fit the full size of the screen by pressing  `Command` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Up`. Pressing `Command` + `Option` + `Shift` + `Down` will return a window to its previous size.
